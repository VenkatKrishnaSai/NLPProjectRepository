suggest O
that O
the O
optimal O

is O
closer O
to O
120 O

relatively O
high O
D(2) O
receptor O
occupancy O
, O
even O
at O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Our O

show O
that O
indomethacin O
, O
a O
known O
cyclooxygenase O
(COX) O
inhibitor O
, O
is O
also O
an O
activator O
of O
CA O
. O
Our O
data O
also O
prove O
that O
indomethacin O
is O
not O
only O
an O
activator O
of O
CA O
but O
also O
antagonizes O
the O

RESULTS O
: O
In O

about O

that O
was O
about O
10 O

However O
, O

approximately O
10-fold O

CONCLUSION O
: O

The O

METHODS O
: O

determined O
by O
measuring O

(15 O

. O
The O
effect O
was O
expressed O
as O
percentage O

was O
directly O

RESULTS O
: O
In O
terms O
of O
inhibition O
of O
TXB2 O
generation O
, O
diclofenac O
was O
about O
1 O

more O
potent O

, O
indicated O
by O

(concentration O

to O
cause O
50% O
of O

effect) O
that O
was O
about O
10 O
times O
lower O
than O
that O
of O

(EC50 O

However O
, O
serum O
concentrations O
of O
meloxicam O
after O
administration O
of O
15 O

were O
approximately O
10-fold O
higher O
than O
those O
of O

Therefore O
there O

no O

between O

The O

of O
both O

was O
significantly O
higher O
at O

CONCLUSION O
: O
These O
data O
show O
that O
meloxicam O
inhibits O

generation O
at O
clinically O
relevant O
doses O
, O
although O
less O
potently O
than O
diclofenac O
. O
Thus O
our O
data O
suggest O
that O
the O
COX-2 O

Because O

in O
1997 O
, O
most O
clinicians O

probably O
most O

consider O
the O

drugs O
have O
slightly O
different O
pharmacological O
properties O
, O
but O
they O
all O
work O
by O

The O
most O
that O

Recent O

that O
the O

primarily O
due O

that O

These O
results O

that O

When O

, O
SB365 O
effectively O
suppressed O

: O
In O

However O
, O

Thus O
our O

suggest O
that O
the O

Because O

In O
this O

we O
aim O

an O
outline O
of O
the O
various O
ways O
in O
which O
BH4 O
affects O

. O
First O
we O
give O
a O
brief O
general O
description O
of O
the O
structure O
and O
catalytic O
mechanism O
of O

, O
with O
special O
emphasis O
on O
those O
aspects O

that O
are O
actively O
debated O
, O
and O
that O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
involve O

. O
Foremost O
among O
those O
issues O
is O
uncoupled O
catalysis O
, O
i.e O
. O
the O
NOS-catalyzed O
oxidation O

in O

of O

or O

that O
does O
not O
result O
in O

. O
We O
also O
shortly O
discuss O
the O
ongoing O
debate O
on O
whether O
NO O
is O
the O
actual O
reaction O

of O
NOS O

, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
phenomenon O
of O
NO-mediated O

We O
describe O
the O
function O
of O
BH4 O
in O
aromatic O
amino O
acid O

, O
and O
discuss O
the O
allosteric O
and O
structural O
effects O
that O
BH4 O
exerts O
on O
NOS O
. O
Next O
we O
turn O
our O
attention O
to O
what O
is O
now O
becoming O
accepted O
as O
the O
central O
function O
of O
BH4 O
: O
its O

Finally O
, O
we O
illustrate O
how O
BH4 O
might O
transform O

into O
an O

This O
conclusion O

based O
on O
the O

observations O

Firstly O
, O
the O
V(max) O

Secondly O
, O
the O

Hence O
, O
it O

that O

Thus O

shows O
that O

Therefore O
, O
pretreatment O

We O

These O

When O

, O
SB365 O
effectively O
suppressed O

Taken O

our O

Therefore O
, O
if O
