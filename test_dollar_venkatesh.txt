suggest O
that O
the O
optimal O

is O
closer O
to O

relatively O
high O
D(2) O
receptor O
occupancy O
, O
even O
at O

that O

also O
an O
activator O

Our O

prove O
that O
indomethacin O
is O
not O
only O
an O

also O
antagonizes O

: O
In O

that O

about O
10 O

However O
, O

approximately O
10-fold O

RESULTS O
: O
In O
terms O

, O

was O
about O

that O

about O
10 O

However O
, O
serum O
concentrations O

approximately O
10-fold O

The O

CONCLUSION O
: O
These O

show O
that O

clinically O
relevant O
doses O
, O
although O
less O
potently O
than O

Thus O
our O

suggest O
that O
the O

in O
1997 O
, O
most O
clinicians O

probably O
most O

would O
consider O
the O
cholinergic O

to O

pharmacotherapy O
for O

moderate O
Alzheimer's O
disease.The O
drugs O
have O
slightly O
different O
pharmacological O
properties O
, O
but O
they O
all O
work O
by O
inhibiting O

The O
most O
that O

Recent O

that O
the O

primarily O
due O

levocetirizine O

Levocetirizine O

that O

These O

When O

SB365 O
effectively O

: O
In O

Thus O

that O
the O

Because O

In O
this O

we O
aim O

provide O
an O
outline O
of O
the O
various O
ways O
in O
which O
BH4 O
affects O

. O
First O
we O
give O
a O
brief O
general O
description O
of O
the O
structure O
and O
catalytic O
mechanism O
of O
NOS O
, O
with O
special O
emphasis O
on O
those O
aspects O

that O
are O
actively O
debated O
, O
and O
that O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
involve O
BH4 O
. O
Foremost O
among O
those O
issues O
is O
uncoupled O
catalysis O
, O
i.e O
. O
the O
NOS-catalyzed O
oxidation O
of O

in O

absence O
of O

or O
pterin O
that O
does O
not O
result O
in O

. O
We O
also O
shortly O
discuss O
the O
ongoing O
debate O
on O
whether O
NO O
is O
the O
actual O
reaction O
product O
of O
NOS O
catalysis O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
phenomenon O
of O
NO-mediated O
autoinhibition O
. O
We O
describe O
the O
function O
of O
BH4 O
in O
aromatic O
amino O
acid O
hydroxylation O
, O
and O
discuss O
the O
allosteric O
and O
structural O
effects O
that O
BH4 O
exerts O
on O
NOS O
. O
Next O
we O
turn O
our O
attention O
to O
what O
is O
now O
becoming O
accepted O
as O
the O
central O
function O
of O
BH4 O
: O
its O
capacity O

of O

Finally O
, O
we O
illustrate O
how O
BH4 O
might O
transform O
the O

dimer O
into O
an O
efficient O

some O

while O

This O
conclusion O

based O
on O
the O
following O
observations O
. O
Firstly O
, O
the O
V(max) O

, O

not O

. O
Secondly O
, O
the O

of O

increased O
in O

Thirdly O
, O

Fourthly O
, O

Hence O
, O
it O

that O

when O

that O

Therefore O
, O
pretreatment O

When O

SB365 O
effectively O

Therefore O
, O
if O

that O

CONCLUSIONS O

Therefore O
, O
if O
